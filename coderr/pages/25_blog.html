        <p><b>METHOD 1 :</b> The first trick is a code snippet from which allows you to convert a normal chrome tab into a notepad. Follow the steps given below to convert a normal tab into a notepad.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the chrome browser.</li>
            <li>Copy and paste the code given below in the search bar of the chrome tab.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>data:text/html, &lt;html contenteditable&gt;</p>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>Hit enter after pasting the above code.</li>
            <li>That's it! You will see a blank screen. You can note down anything there.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Note : You will all the content if you close the tab. So, make sure that you save anything you typed before closing the tab. Below is the steps to save the content :</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Once you are done with writing on the chrome notepad, press <b>CTRL+S</b>.</li>
            <li>A windows explorer pop up will get opened. Select the location where you want to save the document.</li>
            <li>Click on the save button.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>All your content will be downloaded as a HTML file on your computer. You can open this file anytime you want.</p>
        <p><b>METHOD 2 :</b> The second method is a chrome extension named Notepad. <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/">Click here</a> to add this extension to your chrome browser. Click on the “Add To Chrome” and this extension will be installed on your chrome browser as shown in the below animation:</p>
        <p>With the help of Notepad extension, you don't even need to open a new tab. You can start taking notes on pre-existing tabs itself. Whenever you want to take a note, click on the extensions icon and select the Notepad extension. A notepad as shown in the below animation will get open. <br>
        To save your notes, click on the three dotes on the top right corner of the notepad and select <b>Download as Plain Text.</b> A text will be downloaded in your computer.</p>
