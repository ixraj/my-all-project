        <h1>[2023] ₹19,000 PC Build for Coders - The Best Budget Coding Build (Monitor Included)</h1>

        <p>
            Today, we're going to build a PC under 20,000 INR, monitor included, especially for coders. This time, I have
            decided to build the PC from purchase to assembly, step by step. Some people like pre-built, but I never 
            recommend them as they often come with components that might not perform well, and you usually can't pick what
            you want. Plus, upgrading them later is a pain. Building a custom build lets us choose exactly what we need for 
            coding/gaming and opens up better options for upgrades down the line. Also, it's budget-friendly as we have 
            the flexibility to slightly tweak the components. Let's build our coding PC!
        </p>

        <h3>Components</h3>

        <h4>Processor</h4>
        <p>
            For the processor, I have selected the <a href="https://amzn.in/d/efzpjn1" target="_blank">AMD Ryzen 3 3200G</a>. 
            This is an excellent-value budget CPU that delivers surprisingly strong graphics performance, making it a perfect 
            CPU for a budget-friendly Coding PC build.

        <h4>Motherboard</h4>
        <p>
            For the motherboard, I have selected the <a href="https://amzn.in/d/31YiIXV" target="_blank">Ant Value B450MAD4-N
            mATX Gaming Motherboard</a>. This is an excellent-value budget Motherboard at this price range.

        <h4>Ram</h4>
        <p>
            For memory, I'll be utilizing the <a href="https://amzn.in/d/goXNeFr" target="_blank">XPG ADATA GAMMIX D30 DDR4 
            8GB RAM</a> module. This memory module offers a capacity of 8GB and operates on 3200mhz, providing reliable and 
            efficient performance for your budget PC setup.
        </p>

        <h4>Storage</h4>
        <p>
            For storage, I will be incorporating the ZEB-SD26 256 GB Solid State Drive. This SSD brings a capacity of 256 GB, 
            offering ample space to store your data, applications, and operating system.
        </p>
        <img class="blog_2" src="../assets/images/2_ssd.png" alt="storage-image">

        <h4>Cabinet + PSU</h4>
        <p>
            For the <a href="https://amzn.in/d/h4czT5b" target="_blank">cabinet and power supply unit (PSU)</a>, I have 
            opted for the Artis 2520 2.0 C Computer Cabinet. This cabinet provides a functional and compact design to house 
            your components while offering space-efficient organization. Additionally, it comes with an integrated power supply 
            unit (PSU) to efficiently power your system.
        </p>
        <img class="blog_2" src="../assets/images/2_case.png" alt="cabinet-psu-image">

        <h4>Monitor</h4>
        <p>
            As for the monitor, I have selected the <a href="https://amzn.in/d/fB1xsEU" target="_blank">ZEBRONICS Zeb-V16HD 
            LED Monitor</a>. This is one of the best monitors in its price range.
        </p>
        <img class="blog_2" src="../assets/images/2_monitor.png" alt="monitor-image">

        <p>
            As of the time of writing, the estimated cost of this build is approximately ₹16,682 without the monitor. However, 
            it's worth noting that these components could potentially be acquired at even more budget-friendly prices during 
            Amazon and Flipkart sale events.
        </p>

        <h4>Benchmark</h4>
        <p>
            This PC setup strikes a great balance between affordability and performance. When compared to laptops in the 
            30-40k price range, you can expect solid performance from this build. The combination of the <a 
            href="https://amzn.in/d/efzpjn1" target="_blank">processor</a>, <a href="https://amzn.in/d/goXNeFr" target="_blank">
            memory</a>, <a href="https://amzn.in/d/7JoGxC6" target="_blank">storage</a>, <a href="https://amzn.in/d/31YiIXV" 
            target="_blank">motherboard</a>, and integrated graphics ensures a capable and cost-effective computing experience.
