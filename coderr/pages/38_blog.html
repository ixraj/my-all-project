        <h1>How To Install and Setup VirtualBox in Windows 10 in 2021?</h1>
        <p>If you are an IT professional or an IT student, I am sure you will definitely encounter a situation where you will need to work on multiple operating systems. One way to install more than one operating system is dual booting your computer, but this can be difficult for a beginner. The most recommended and the easiest method is installing Oracle Virtual Box. Virtual Box gives you the functionality of running multiple operating systems on your host operating system. This article will tell you how you can install the latest Virtual Box version in the Windows 10 operating system.</p>
        <p>Follow the steps given below to install Virtual Box on Windows 10:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>First of all, you need to download the Virtual Box installer. <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank">Click here,</a> and you will be redirected to the official download page of Virtual Box. Download the binary version for <b>Windows hosts.</b></li>
            <li>Run the executable file as soon as the download completes.</li>
            <li>A custom setup dialog box will be displayed after starting the executable file, as shown in the below animation.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Click on the “Next” button to install Virtual Box in the default settings and location, or you can change the installation directory by clicking on the “Browse” button.</p>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>Virtual Box will give you a Network Interface Warning as shown in the below animation during the installation. Proceed further by clicking “Yes.”</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Note</b>: Clicking yes will disconnect your computer from the internet connection. If you are downloading some other application or file, I suggest you pause it or wait until the installation of Virtual Box completes.</p>
        <ol start="5">
            <li>After this, a “Ready To Install” dialog box will be displayed. Click on the “Install” button to start the installation process.</li>
            <li>Now, a Windows security message will be popped up on your screen. This message will ask you to install Oracle Universal Serial Bus. Click on the “Install” to continue the installation process.</li>
            <li>After this, most probably, you will see a usual Windows User Account Control Warning. Click “Yes” to continue.</li>
            <li>After that, Virtual Box should be installed on your computer. Now, you can easily install the operating system of your choice by launching the Virtual Box.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Checking “Start Oracle VM Virtual Box” will launch the Virtual Box just after installation. Uncheck this option if you want to launch Virtual Box later. So, that's how you easily install Virtual Box in Windows 10.</p>
