        <h1>[October 2021] Best Laptop Models to Buy For College Students</h1>
        <p>In this blog, we will be discussing the best laptop models to buy for students. Before buying any laptop you should consider these points first.</p>
        <ul class="blog_22">
            <li>Importance of SSD: </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You should always prefer a laptop with SSD. SSDs are 10X faster than mechanical hard drives and are highly recommended these days. SSDs usually have a longer life compared to mechanical drives.</p>

        <ul class="blog_22">
            <li>Importance of Recent Processors: </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The processor is responsible for processing the data. Better the processor better computations can be performed by it. More threads and cores mean better multitasking(multiprocessing). Higher-generation processors are usually better in terms of performance and pricing.</p>

        <ul class="blog_22">
            <li>How to get Discounts?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can get very good deals during Flipkart Big Billion Days Sale and Amazon's Great Indian Festival Sale.</p>

        <ul class="blog_22">
            <li>How much Ram is sufficient?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>RAM is responsible for storing the programs temporarily in the volatile memory. The higher and faster the RAM, the better the multitasking performance. For an average user I suggest 8 GB of ram is enough.</p>

        <ul class="blog_22">
            <li>Do you need a Graphics Card?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are interested in gaming, video editing, or graphics-intensive software like Blender, Premiere Pro/After-Effects, you will need a good graphic card. Otherwise, graphic cards will not hamper your experience on your machine.</p>
